            Communication skills are the techniques and abilities used to convey
            information efficiently. These encompass a range of abilities from
            verbal communication skills, such as articulating thoughts clearly,
            to cues like hand gestures, eye contact, and facial expressions.
            Communication skills also encompass writing and digital proficiency

            Good communication is a soft skill that fosters better collaboration
            between team members. When employees give and receive feedback and
            actively listen, they understand each other’s expectations. This

            workplace allow teams to accomplish more in their workdays as they
            collaborate on projects and work towards the same objectives. Where
            ideas and tasks aren’t communicated well, it can lead to delays and

            excellent communication skills examples that can be invaluable to
            conflict resolution include active listening, maintaining eye

            Verbal communication involves using spoken words, voice, and clear

            Verbal communication can easily lead to misunderstandings if the
            speech used or the choice of vocabulary is unclear. Unless you are
            recording the communication, it can also be difficult to recall what
            was said in a situation. This makes it critical to use both verbal
            and other methods of communication for clarity.

            <strong>Example of verbal communication:</strong>A face-to-face

            Visual communication skill involves using elements like charts,

            Digital communication is essential for effectively exchanging

            Understanding when and how to use these skills to set the
            appropriate tone while remaining clear and concise is essential in

            Listening skills are crucial for effective communication. Active
            listening, in particular, involves paying full attention to others
            without pre-formulating a response. It demonstrates understanding
            and respect, allowing for more thoughtful and appropriate replies.
            An active listener is also more prepared to ask relevant questions
            and act on clear feedback.

            showing that he understands. This helps de-escalate the situation as

            Negotiation is the art of engaging in discussions that lead to
            mutually acceptable agreements. Professionals use this skill to
            communicate effectively by presenting business offers and closing
            them in ways that all parties can understand and agree to.
            Negotiation skills often involve finding compromises, advocating for
            different interests, and maintaining respect and professionalism.

            Providing feedback that is supportive and considerate is a skill in
            itself. Criticism without actionable insights can easily demotivate
            employees, increasing stress and the risk of burnout. However, when
            feedback highlights strengths and suggests areas for improvement, it
            can motivate and empower employees to grow and perform better.

            Effective conflict de-escalation involves two key elements. First,
            recognising body language and emotions to identify when conflict is
            imminent. Second, using the right communication style to reduce
            tensions and help both parties understand each other’s perspectives.
            When communicated effectively, differing views can foster
            collaboration and strengthen relationships, rather than causing
            stress and conflict.

          <span>
            Delegating tasks to employees can be challenging. There’s a risk of
            over- or under-delegation, leading to perceptions of bias or
            favouritism, even when unintentional. Using delegation skills to
            decide which tasks to assign and clearly communicating the reasoning
            behind decisions is essential for ensuring all employees feel
            treated fairly.

            during weekly meetings to help her develop specific skills. Alice
            questions why Sarah is being assigned the tasks over her or Alex,
            prompting Tony to explain his decision. Realising the task
            distribution may be uneven, Tony adjusts duties across the team to
            give everyone a chance to upskill.
